   - Create a prompt asking what the user wants to do, then ask for 2 numbers.
   - Plug all of their inputs into the operate functions parameters and return or console.log the results.

Second Step:

  Create UI for the Calculator:
   - Created a list of all buttons the calculator should have i.e: =, *,etc.
   - Arranged all buttons using CSS Grid.
   - Styled the buttons to make it appealing.


Third Step:

  Wiring up the JavaScript:
   - Created mulitple event listeners; when user clicks on an operator, numbers, etc.
   - Used objects to store the values of both the operator and the results.
   - Everytime a user clicks the equals operator, the evaluationOperation function takes the first value and the second value from the object along with the operator and performs a calculation using the operate function. It then stores the result of the operation in what was the first value.
